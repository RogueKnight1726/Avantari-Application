The application was made by me, Swathy, as part of an interview process for the job of iOS Application developer at Avantari.

I have used the prescribed SocketIO library to fetch the values from the server via a socket connection, and thereby store the received values in the phone using RealmSwift (https://github.com/realm), I have triggered Notifications  on events where the response from the server is repeated.

I have used the Charts library to implement the graph
https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts.

All images were made by myself using InkScape

What I always try to achieve while developing iOS application is to achieve a very efficient and beautiful implementation of the MVC coding pattern.
I always keep my code with 0 Warnings in xcode.
